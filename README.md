# Eslint + Prettier + VScode

This is a quick way to check your Javascript code and make it pretty too.

It uses Eslint to verify the code, but uses Prettier to format it, and brings the AirBNB Javascript style guide to make the code universally accepted.

You don't have to follow any of the rules and suggestions, but it is a good starting point, so you don't have to reinvent the wheel.

##  Installing the settings

Let's assume you already have `npm` and `npx` installed. You will need these to complete your linter.
